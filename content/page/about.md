## Let me introduce myself

I'm a highly motivated and passionate Data Scientist whose dream is to use my talents in machine learning/AI and deep learning to solve real-world problems and make the customer achieve more..

Ever since I was little kid, software and gaming development has been my passion. I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. Later I get to know about machine learning where we can explicitly train computer to do the task without using any conditional statements. I was amazed by this technology and I knew that I have to do my major in this. I have learned mathematics behind every popular model and algorithms which gave me a good grip and deep intuition in deep learning. I learned python because it was really easy to learn and very powerful to manipulate data and train some really complex models. Apart from coding I play video games a lot especially counter strike, this urge of understanding machine learning started from this game, where I wanted to create such bots that can not be defeated by a human. I am still learning Reinforcement Learning to complete this task. I want to understand things clearly and want to explain it to others fluently. So, now, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful. 


<!-- Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremelly fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
